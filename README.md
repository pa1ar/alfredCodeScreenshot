- padding (around the code, list of values supported by raycast)
- background (enabled or disabled)
- title (is displayed as title of the "window")
- dark mode (enabled or disabled)
- width (min 520, default is auto)

## Usage

1. Select your code 
2. Trigger universal action named `Generate Image From Selected Code`.
